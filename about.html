	<p>If you're looking for a chemical engineer, you're in the wrong place. Did you know that maintaining pipes and reactors is as boring as it sounds? I didn't, and switched majors as soon as I could get my hands on the internal transfer application.</p>
	<h2>If you're looking for a Content Strategist, you're in the right place.</h2>
	<p>I'm currently a senior Advertising major at the University of Texas at Austin, where we drown our sorrows in overpriced breakfast tacos and really nice beer. While here, I've masted the arts of concise copy (1, 2, 3), intuitive UX flows, and (semi-decent) code.
	<br>I've had some side hustles as well. I've been a Content Strategy (UX Writer) intern at Facebook, a Marketing intern at Edlio, and a Technical Writer at the Applied Research Laboratories.<br>
	I'm a firm believer that world will be a better, more beautiful place with more heartfelt, user-centric design. If you're with me, let's chat.</p>
